# Following through the Stanford Deep Learning / NLP course

This is a work-through of the instance of the course which ran from March 30th,
2015 to June 8th, 2015.

I first discovered it on May 4th, 2015, Singapore time, thanks to a [link][post]
shared on the Data Science Singapore [Facebook Group][DSSG].

## My working environment

I am using Python 2.7.3 and 2.7.6 with numpy 1.9.2 on various Ubuntu machines as
the [first lecture][Lect1V] mentioned that Python/numpy was in use and those are
the versions I could get most quickly on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.
